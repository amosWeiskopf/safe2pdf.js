Feel free to use this JS, fork it, spoon it, whatever you like, under the non-commercial license included at the top of the file.
Feel free to reach me (Amos, the creator) either here on GitHub or via https://safe2pdf.com/#contact

I wish you great luck in everything you do.
Viva la medicina. God bless you.
